# A Complete Guide to Machine Learning Models

This repository contains **beginner friendly tutorial notebooks** on traiditional machine learning models. 

Each notebook consists of:

- an **introudction** to the model
- an **intuitive explanation** (easy to understand) on how the model works
- a **detailed explanation** (with diagrams, formulas ect.) on how the model works
- a **coding example** demonstrating how you can implement the model to solve a problem
